### Standard Module Structure

Each module follows this exact structure:

```
Module Name/
├── Lectures/          # Lecture slides, notes, recordings
├── Labs/              # Lab exercises, code, reports
├── Assignments/       # Assignment briefs, solutions, submissions
├── Past Tests/        # Historical test and exam materials
│   ├── Exams/        # Final exams, mid-terms
│   └── Tests/        # Quizzes, class tests
└── Extra/            # Additional resources, cheat sheets, references
```

### File Naming Conventions

- For lectures: `<Lecture Num> - <Name of Lecture>.pdf` (e.g. `Lecture 1 - Introduction to Programming.pdf`)
- For tests/exams: `<Test_Num_Year>.pdf` (e.g. `Test_2_2023.pdf`)
